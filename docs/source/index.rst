Welcome to autocalc documentation!
==================================

The primary purpose of autocalc is to foster the creation of interactive apps from your Jupyter notebooks by providing a
framework to setup the dependencies between your variables and ensuring they are kept in sync.
Although other similar framework exist, autocalc shines in its simplicity and ease-of-use.
It is targeted mainly at data-scientist who would like to turn their notebook into an app without having to learn external libraries.
